            <p class="description">These guys redid my whole back yard. We had a huge moss problem, they ripped it up, brought in new loam, leveled it and hyrdoseeded. They worked fast and did a great job. I couldn't be happier with the quality work they did.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="review2text">

            <p class="description">The Trustees of Sutton Pond have been very pleased with the snowplowing and landscaping services provided by Emanouil Brothers for the past months. Possibly more important than the Trustees' opinion is the opinion of the unit owners from whom we have received many positive comments regarding the condo grounds.</p>

            <p class="description">I would like to sincerely thank you for your commitment as well as your team's dedication to talk on a weekly basis (I should say daily basis) and resolve any issues that arose. It was truly a pleasure to have you and the rest of your guys work with us to manage countless complex issues. Whether it was schedule, sequence, manpower, details, coordination with other trades, safety, quality management, financial, or general problem solving issues, you and your team stepped up to do whatever it took to get it done.</p>

            <p class="description">I wanted to convey my appreciation for your effort and the results at Menotomy Rocks. I know that it was a difficult process, especially with the need for the park to remain open during construction and the intense neighborhood scrutiny. The conduct and cooperation from your crews was exceptional.</p>

            <p class="description">Please accept our sincere thanks for Emanouil Brother's participation in the recent landscaping improvement project done at the Billerica Boys &amp; Girls Club. Seth Roosevelt [Project Manager], in particular, was instrumental in the design of the area, selection of plantings, planning and execution of the project. He worked closely with the folks from AS&amp;E and Club representatives planning the project and providing supervision and worked with the AS&amp;E folks throughout the day.</p>
